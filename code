                    So this guide is going to focus on adult content.
                    NON-ADULT: WHAT TO POST ON ONLYFANS
                    Although itâ€™s used mainly for adult content, OnlyFans is not just for adult content. Here are some example content ideas you can post outside of adult content:
                    Photography
                    Cooking/recipes
                    Fitness/workouts
                    Musical instrument lessons
                    Art
                    Makeup tutorials",

		"name": "WHAT KIND OF CONTENT SHOULD YOU POST ON ONLYFANS?",
		"description": "When creating content you should consider what kind of content youâ€™re shooting and where youâ€™re gonna post it â€“ social media? free onlyfans? PPV? paid page?
                    At onlyfans.guide we make a distinction between:
                    Promo content (which is given away for free for promo purposes)
                    Premium content (which is paid for via OF subscriptions and/or PPV)
                    We recommend structuring a sales funnel like this:
                    Social Media -> Free OnlyFans -> Paid OnlyFans -> Custom content",

                    Clean your shooting location (no one wants to see a messy room)
                    If shooting with a mirrorâ€¦clean it.
                    Declutter your room or shooting location (unless you want that prop in the background it will just distract from YOU)
                    Alternatively consider just blurring the background after the fact (use Facetune 2 or other similar apps)
                    Make sure there are no identifiable things in the background (there are many creeps out there so donâ€™t doxx yourself)
                    Always consider your lighting. Search around for good natural indoor lighting or use a ring light and/or other lighting equipment.
                    Have your hair/makeup/clothes & skin prepped to shoot. ",

		"description": "Watch out for social media trends and memes.
                    Often, you can leverage a meme to produce some content thatâ€™s trendy right now.
                    For example, consider the:
                    ðŸ’¡30 POV roleplay meme (LINK)
                    The POV Roleplay meme gives the viewer an unusual perspective of a certain object/person during a specific interaction involving that object/person.
                     Originating from TikTok (hashtag #POV on TikTok), the meme usually includes a caption like POV: Youâ€™re [object/person in a situation] and a funny video or pic.",
